Here is a clear, sharp 3-minute English pitch explaining the deadlock memory / kernel panic incident, suitable for management, N3 teams, and post-mortems.

✅ 3-Minute Pitch – Deadlock Memory Incident (English)

We faced a kernel panic on multiple RHEL 8.10 servers with the message “System is deadlocked on memory”.
This issue occurred during the early boot phase, before systemd started, and was triggered by memory exhaustion inside the initramfs.

1. What actually happened

During boot, the Linux kernel must reserve several memory regions before the operating system loads:

HugePages (Oracle SGA)

crashkernel (kdump reservation)

kernel free-memory pool

early systemd/journald buffers

DRACUT modules to detect LVM and the root filesystem


In our case, the number of HugePages configured was much larger than the available RAM on the server (8 GB).
This caused the kernel to run out of free, contiguous memory during initialization.

When the kernel cannot allocate the required memory:

journald is killed by the OOM killer

DRACUT cannot mount the root filesystem

systemd never starts

the kernel enters a deadlock state and panics


This is why the system repeatedly failed to boot.


---

2. Why the issue appeared suddenly

Although HugePages were configured months ago, Oracle memory usage increased recently (SGA growth, patch, automatic memory management, or higher workload).
At reboot, the kernel attempted to pre-allocate all HugePages at once and no longer had enough RAM available.

Additionally, the existing initramfs still contained old memory parameters, so even reducing HugePages in sysctl had no effect until:

initramfs was rebuilt

GRUB configuration was regenerated

3. How we fixed it

To restore the boot process, we:

1. Booted into rescue mode


2. Activated LVM and mounted the root filesystem


3. Reduced the HugePages value to a realistic level


4. Rebuilt initramfs so the kernel uses the updated memory settings


5. Regenerated GRUB


6. Rebooted successfully



The system now starts normally, with sufficient free memory for DRACUT, systemd, and Oracle.


---

4. Key lessons

HugePages must always be sized according to the actual SGA, not guessed values

Changing sysctl is not enough unless initramfs is rebuilt

Small-RAM servers running Oracle are highly sensitive to memory reservation

Kernel deadlock is caused by early-boot memory exhaustion, long before systemd starts


This was not an OS bug: it was a memory reservation imbalance between Oracle requirements and available physical RAM.
