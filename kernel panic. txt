Here is a clear, professional summary in English of the actions you performed, ready to send to managers, IBM Cloud, or your internal engineering team.

✅ Technical Summary – HugePages Adjustment & Boot Recovery Actions

During the recovery of the affected RHEL 8.10 VM, several corrective actions were applied to stabilize memory usage and prevent repeated kernel panics.

1. Reduced the HugePages Allocation

The HugePages count was lowered from a previous oversized value to a more appropriate configuration:

vm.nr_hugepages = 2560

Purpose

Prevent excessive static memory reservation during early boot

Ensure that the kernel and systemd have sufficient RAM before Oracle allocates SGA

Avoid another “System is deadlocked on memory” kernel panic



---

2. Updated Kernel Parameters to Prevent Panic Loops

The following settings were applied:

kernel.panic_on_oops = 0
vm.panic_on_oom = 0

Purpose

Avoid reboot loops or immediate kernel panic on minor faults

Allow the system to continue booting instead of halting on OOM

Improve stability when memory pressure occurs during system initialization



---

3. Regenerated GRUB Configuration

A full rebuild of the GRUB configuration was executed:

grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

Purpose

Ensure the GRUB bootloader uses updated kernel arguments

Apply new kernel command-line parameters (HugePages, THP, panic controls, etc.)

Synchronize boot settings after system modifications



---

4. Rebuilt the Initramfs Image

The initramfs for the active kernel was regenerated:

KVER=4.18.0-553.7.1.el8_10.x86_64
dracut -f /boot/initramfs-$KVER.img $KVER

Purpose

Re-inject correct LVM, virtio, and storage modules

Ensure rootvg-root and rootvg-swap are discovered at boot

Resolve previous initramfs corruption that caused dracut emergency shell and kernel panic

Apply new kernel parameters consistently from the earliest boot stage



---

5. Improved Journald Resource Limits

The /etc/systemd/journald.conf file was updated to cap log memory and disk consumption:

SystemMaxUse=400M
SystemKeepFree=500M
RuntimeMaxUse=150M

Purpose

Prevent journald from consuming excessive memory early in boot

Avoid OOM kills on systemd-journald

Improve system resilience under low-memory conditions



---

🎯 Final Result

After applying the above changes:

The kernel panic ("System is deadlocked on memory") no longer occurs

The VM boots normally

Memory pressure during early boot is significantly reduced

Oracle memory allocation no longer blocks system startup

Initramfs and GRUB configurations are now consistent and functional
