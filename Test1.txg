Here is a short, clear, professional English answer you can send to the business teams:

Using yum instead of dnf does not create application-level stability issues.
On RHEL8 and RHEL9, yum is only a compatibility wrapper that internally calls dnf. Both use the same backend, the same dependency solver, and the same RPM transactions.
The behaviour and results are identical.
